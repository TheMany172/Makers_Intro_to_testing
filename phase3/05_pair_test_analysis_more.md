# Challenge - Analysis (Part 2)

Like the previous exercise, this is a paired piece of work. For this challenge,
you will submit materials so your coach(es) can provide feedback.

Also as before, there is nothing implemented, so there is no application to look
at, play with, nor to run tests against.

This challenge tests your skills and approaches that you've been building and
using earlier on.

## Resources

These materials relate to a project which is similar to Airbnb, where different
types of user can list spaces which can be hired (along with details like cost),
or can hire spaces which are still available to be hired. It's called MakersBnB.

This MakersBnB project is used in other Makers courses for learning software
development, but note: you're not going to be implementing the application! The
resources are just provided for you to analyse what might be built by a team of
developers and think about how you might test it.

The resources are the
[specification](https://github.com/makersacademy/engineering-project-1/blob/main/specification.md)
and its associated
[mockups/wireframes](https://github.com/makersacademy/engineering-project-1/blob/main/MakersBnB_mockups.pdf).
You can choose whether you consider just the "Headline specifications" or the
"Nice-to-haves" as well, in your work.

## Challenge

This is a process feedback challenge. For this challenge, you won't be
submitting a video but instead you'll be providing a link to GitHub where you've
put resources you've created - this could be anything from diagrams to bullet
lists to test cases.

Like the previous scenario, you will work from the materials to analyse those
functional requirements then plan an exploratory testing activity.

1. Do an initial read through of the provided resources (project specification
   and the associated mockups/wireframes)
2. Work through the project specification and wireframes, analysing their
   functional requirements, thinking about **what** you can test
3. Make notes on anything you think is important, as you go:
    * Potential test areas
    * Risks
    * Assumptions and/or questions
    * etc.
4. Draw diagrams (state, mind map, etc.) where you think they will help your
   understanding and/or planning
5. Draw up a list of parts of the project you would focus on in, say, a first 90
   minute long exploratory testing session - you may want to work out what's
   important to cover first, for example
6. Write down **how** you might test those parts of the project - include test
   cases, steps test data and anything else that you think is needed
7. Commit your resources to GitHub and submit your challenge

[After you're done, submit your challenge with a link to your GitHub
repository](https://airtable.com/shrNFgNkPWr3d63Db?prefill_Item=itt_as02).
