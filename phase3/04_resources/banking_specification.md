# Banking Application

## Functional Specification

| Specification Id | Details |
|-|-|
| BANK-01 | User can enter username and password into a login page to log in to the banking application
| BANK-02 | User can view all of their accounts in one page
| BANK-03 | User can view details of a single account, including balance and transaction history
| BANK-04 | A transaction page allows a user to specify an amount of money, a from account and a to account
| BANK-05 | A transaction causes an amount of money to move from one account to another, altering both account balances appropriately

## Assumptions

To make this exercise a little smaller, here are some assumptions that you can make for the purpose of this given application:

* Users already exist in the system - there's no sign-up functionality
* Accounts already exist and already have money in them - there's no depositing, withdrawals, etc.
* Accounts are referenced by some sort of unique identification number (as shown in one of the wireframes)
