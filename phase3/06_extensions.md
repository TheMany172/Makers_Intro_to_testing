# Extensions

The testing community is a welcoming and busy one, with a number of "famous"
names and faces, many of which offer up ideas, approaches and opinions in a
variety of different formats. There are blogs, videos, courses, Twitter feeds
and a whole lot more.

For this set of extensions before phase four starts tomorrow, take a look around
"the testing community", read/watch things that take your fancy and start to get
some familiarity of what's out there. Some possible starting points, suggestions
and actual resources are:

* Speak with your coach(es)! Maybe they've read something recently that might be
  of interest or have a favourite blog they're willing to recommend.
* The [Ministry of Testing](https://www.ministryoftesting.com) lists on its
  homepage recent blog posts from testers (and others) in the industry.
* Similarly, [5blogs](https://5blogs.wordpress.com) lists a curated set of 5
  posts from the previous 24 hours.
* If you feel like watching a video, here's a [90 min pairing session by Sam
  Connelly and James Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87Wle_VLyJ8).
