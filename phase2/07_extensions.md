# Extension

At the end of our exploratory testing sessions, we have been writing up a
"report" of what we did, what we found, and some specifics on observations that
were thought to be noteworthy or valuable in some way.

Those specific observations were made up of things like what we observed, what
we were expecting to see or happen instead, and steps for how to reproduce the
observation. For now, we'll call these "bugs". We'll look at what goes into a
bug in more detail in the upcoming sections.

There are lots of different tools and systems available for tracking bugs and
they're commonly called bug tracking tools or bug tracking systems. Your
coach(es) will be running a session tomorrow which looks at some of the
following tools - you can take a look now at a few of them. Don't worry about
trying to understand these bugs or products which have the bugs in them! We're
just using them to gain some appreciation of the tools and the sorts of things
they can be used for.

* Bugzilla
  * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?format=specific
* JIRA
  * https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/GROOVY/issues/GROOVY-10594?filter=allopenissues
  * https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LOG4J2/issues/LOG4J2-2649?filter=allopenissues
  * https://subversion.apache.org

Ask yourself some questions:

* What common things do the different bug tracking tools have? What are their
  differences?
* What sorts of things are being recorded in a "bug" when it is first reported?
* What sorts of things happen in a bug report after it has been reported?

If you have any examples you can or want to bring along to the coaching session
tomorrow, please do note them down and raise them in that session.
