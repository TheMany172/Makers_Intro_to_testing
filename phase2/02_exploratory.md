# Exploratory Testing

While your coach(es) will be running a session on this, here is some
accompanying course material.

## What is it?

Exploratory testing is a test approach that allows someone to learn about the
product, as they test and as a result of the tests that they run.

The key is the first word in the term - exploration - and is a learning journey
that can inform lots of things:

* The tester, about how the product works
* The tester, about what might be worth testing next
* Subsequently, stakeholders/developers/etc. about where there are problems

Because exploratory testing is driven by what's being learnt about the product
and information resulting from testing, it's not something that can be
automated.

Exploratory testing can be done at any time when there is something against
which tests can be run.

It's especially useful in black box type situations where there's no knowledge
of the implementation, and sometimes it's useful when there's no expectations at
all about how the product should behave! You could go and visit any website or
install any application and start exploratory testing it, with no documentation
or information to tell you what it should do or how it does it.

That said, exploratory testing isn't only useful in black box situations - it
can be useful in any situation.

## Who does it?

While exploratory testing can be done by anyone, it's best done by someone with
some experience.

This could be someone like an experienced tester who has run such sessions
before, has good analytical skills or a good understanding of typical use cases.
However, it's possible that someone like a product manager or anyone else who
knows what the product should do could also do a good job, provided they have
the necessary testing skills.

## Timeboxing

A common question that comes up during testing is "when should I stop?". Given
testing is a very open-ended activity, and there's probably an infinite number
of tests that could be run, knowing how many is "sufficient" or "appropriate" is
a real and ever-present challenge.

While we're able to make informed decisions about in what order we test (e.g.
risk-based), one frequent factor in making a good stopping point is time. As
testers, there's also never an infinite amount of time and often less time than
you might like for even the higher priority things, so either choosing to limit
ourselves or being limited by external factors, can produce a stopping point.

One thing that can be done during exploratory testing is "timeboxing" the
activity. This means you set yourself a time limit and explore the product until
that time is met. After that, you write up what you did, what you found, and
report back.

By timeboxing our activities:

* We can focus better on trying to achieve what we planned, by choosing when to
  move on to a new area
* We give ourselves a proper stopping point rather than have the exploration run
  on too long/forever and not provide timely feedback
* We can use the end of the time to review what was done, sometimes resulting in
  a new - timeboxed - exploratory testing session to look at something else or
  something a second time but in a different way

## Tools

The basic tools you need are simply a pen and paper for planning, note-taking
and reporting. Other tools can be used, such as those which allow you to capture
video or planning tools, and while they can be useful, they aren't mandatory.

## Note-Taking & Reporting

An important activity to do during exploratory testing is to take notes while
you're exploring.

If you think - I can just write them at the end, can't I? - then there's a few
reasons why that's not advisable. By writing notes as you explore:

* you don't forget what things you've explored or what tests you've already run,
  so you know what's next during, and what to put in a summary at the end
* you are producing documentation that shows that tests were run and what those
  were, which can be important for things like auditing
* if you find a potential issue, you can look back at the steps that lead up to
  it (this can be very important - more on this, later)

Similarly, producing a final report of your exploratory session is important as
well:

* A stakeholder can more quickly understand what was done, what was found, and
  sometimes crucially what was not done
* It can allow a peer, such as another tester, to review what was done and make
  suggestions - these could be about further tests that could be run, through to
  interpretations of behaviour and whether the observations might actually be
  issues which need a follow-up
* Like before, for auditing purposes
* Materials to support the testing are documented and preserved, and perhaps can
  be reused in later sessions or contribute towards automation efforts

## Charters

A piece of terminology you might see when looking into exploratory testing is
the concept of a "charter".

A charter is something that can be used in exploratory testing, and includes
like a statement of the intent of the testing and its objectives, as well as
things like how the tests will be run.
