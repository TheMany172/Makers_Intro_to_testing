# More on Note-Taking

As you read in [Exploratory Testing](02_exploratory.md), taking notes when
testing can be useful for you in a number of different ways.

## Retrospective

Take a moment now to think back to the exercise you just did with the sign-up
web form.

* Did you take notes?
* Did you take enough or too many/few?
* How did it feel taking notes as you went?
* How did you take notes (pen & paper, VS code/text editor, etc.)?
* What format did they take (linear as time progressed, something more complex)?
* Were your notes more about behaviours and outputs, or learning about the form
  and new ideas, or a mix?
* Did you take any other forms of notes, like copies of output text,
  screenshots, videos?

There is no "right way" to take notes - so long as you're taking some - but
there might be "good ways" in certain contexts.

## Mind maps

One interesting way of structuring information is in a mind map. (Note, it's not
the only way and flat text files, spreadsheets, or anything else can also be
useful.)

Mind maps allow for a hierarchy of information - for example, a "parent node" or
"root node" could be the application, and its "child nodes" are parts of that
application. Child nodes of those could then by sub-parts or individual bits of
functionality... or test ideas.

[Wikipedia has a nice gallery of
examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map#Gallery) giving you an idea of
the sort of structure, and potential complexity.

Mind maps can be a useful tool both when planning testing and when note-taking
during exploratory testing.

There are various free applications and sites where you can create mind maps,
including Miro (which you may already have used!), so feel free to try a couple
out and find one that seems to do what you might want and find useful.

## Optional Resources

If you want to read more about thoughts on note-taking during exploratory
testing, Michael Bolton talks about this and other things in [An Exploratory
Tester's
Notebook](https://www.developsense.com/presentations/2007-10-PNSQC-AnExploratoryTestersNotebook.pdf).
