# ThingsBoard

ThingsBoard is described as an open-source IoT (Internet of Things) platform
providing dashboards for data visualisation, among other things.

You'll be using ThingsBoard as an opportunity to exercise your skills and use
what you've learnt to do some testing. Feel free to share your findings with
others in the cohort doing this exercise and/or your coach(es).

**Important**: ThingsBoard is not a Makers product, so don't go off running SQL
Injection tests or Denial of Service attacks against it! If you're ever unsure:
stop, then consult with your coach(es).

## Getting Started

1. Complete the sign up form at https://thingsboard.cloud/signup
2. You'll be sent an activation email - use this to activate your account.
3. Once logged in, visit the *Manage Solution Templates* -> *Solution Templates*
   page.
4. You can click the "Install" button next to any of these solutions to
   initialise it with some example data. Let's start by clicking Install in the
   "Temperature and Humidity Sensors" section.
5. You'll be shown instructions about Devices/Sensors, Alarms, Customers and so
   on. Read though it to gain some information about what the dashboard can do
   and what you've already got configured. Think through it as you go - what
   data is there, what are the inputs, what can you change, etc.
6. After dismissing that information, you'll be taken to a dashboard titled
   "Sensors", where you will see details of some sensors, some alarms, and a
   map.

## Exercise

Plan then do one or more sessions of exploratory testing of the Sensors
dashboard in ThingsBoard.

That's right - those are all the instructions! We've giving you a much more
open-ended exercise where you get to decide what you'll do and how, as this is a
more likely scenario a tester may encounter in a professional setting. You're up
and running with something, you've been given some details about it and now it's
over to you for the next steps.

### Other Domains

If you want, you can always return to the Solution Templates page and install a
different solution, should you want or need to analyse some data from a
different domain.
