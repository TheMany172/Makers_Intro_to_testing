# Functional & Non-Functional

Testing can be split into (at least) these two different types - functional and
non-functional testing. Throughout the course, you will have encountered both
types, so far with an emphasis on the former.

## Functional Testing

Simply put, functional testing looks at the functionality of the thing being
tested.

The requirements of that functionality come from the sorts of things you've seen
before, such as user stories, program specifications but also things like other
business requirements but may even be undocumented.

Functional testing will look at the correctness or appropriateness, and the
behaviours of "what" the thing being tested does.

## Non-Functional

While functional testing looks at the "what", non-functional looks at "how well"
the thing does it.

Non-functional testing covers a lot of different areas of testing, some of which
are listed here and at least a couple will be familiar:

* Security
* Performance
* Load
* Stress
* Usability
* Maintainability
* Installability

A misconception is that non-functional testing must follow after functional
testing, suggesting it occurs nearer "the end" but the reality is that
non-functional testing can, and often should, be considered and carried out
earlier in the development life cycle as well.

For some of the areas, such as security and usability, it's common to find
testers with specific knowledge (such as penetration testers for Security) and
also to have non-test roles within an organisation focusing on those areas (such
as a User Experience (UX) specialist for Usability).

## Exercise

Which of the two categories above do you think each of these falls under or
relates to?

* Unit testing / test-driven development
* Proofreading an application's accompanying Help details or manual
* Availability testing
* Exploratory testing

If you need to, do some searching online for any new terminology.
