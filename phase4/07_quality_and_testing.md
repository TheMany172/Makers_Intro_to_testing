# Quality & Testing

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/quality_engineering/intro_to_testing/phase4/workshops/quality_and_testing.x.md)_

While your coach(es) will be running a session on this here is some accompanying
course material.

## Quality?

You're towards the end of this week and "quality" has been mentioned a few times
by now, including in coaching sessions, group discussions and various bits of
work.

But... what is quality? What's your definition or explanation, if someone were
now to ask you what it was?

## Testing?

Similarly, "testing" has not only been mentioned a lot but you've been doing a
lot of testing too!

So, what is testing? What would you say to someone who asked what software
testing was, or why it was important in software development?

Finally, what's the relationship or association between "testing" and "quality"?
What's your opinion on it now you are towards the end of the week?
