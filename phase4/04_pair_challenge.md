# Challenge

This is a process feedback challenge. That means you should record yourself
doing it and submit that recording to your coach for feedback. [How do I do
this?](../pills/process_feedback_challenges.md)

> **Note**: For this challenge, record yourself as you talk through your planned
> test activities (there is no need to record yourself while you do the
> installation or do the planning of the testing).

A Makers-created clone of [Trello](https://trello.com/en) has been partially
built and you've been asked to test it and provide feedback to the stakeholder
and developers.

## Resources

The repository for the Trello clone is
https://github.com/makersacademy/lm1-debugging-sample-codebase.

You'll need to browse the repository in order to find some things out, so please
do take the opportunity to get comfortable exploring what you're given to see
what you can find that's useful or informative.

## Guidance

Note that the application is a "work in progress" - there are some known bugs
already listed under "Bug Fixes" in the documentation, and also a list of "New
Features" that have not yet been implemented.

Your testing of the Trello clone is representative of what you could see in a
professional setting, both in terms of its incomplete state and what's being
asked of you in terms of testing. There is documentation around how to get it
installed locally on your own machine which you will need to follow, before you
can run any tests against it.

Remember: you're not supposed to be implementing (nor fixing, nor updating) the
application!

For this challenge, you should **do what you think is appropriate** with regards
to the request of you to "test it and provide feedback". There is guidance below
on the materials for your submission.

## Submission

Start to record a video after you have got the application installed and
running, and have done your planning of test activities, but *before you run any
tests*. Please include in your video:

* A summary, talking through what planning you did, how you approached it, any
  diagrams used or drawn, and ideas for tests to run
* Live testing of the Trello clone
* A wrap up of your session - what did you find, etc.

In terms of materials to submit, please include your video and at least one
written bug report on an issue that's different to the "Bug Fixes" already
listed in the documentation from the repository. If you found multiple bugs,
which one you report is up to you.

[After you're done, submit your recording and accompanying
materials](https://airtable.com/shrNFgNkPWr3d63Db?prefill_Item=itt_as03).
