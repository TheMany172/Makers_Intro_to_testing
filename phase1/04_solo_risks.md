# Exercise - Risks

This exercise is a solo piece of work, made up of a few different topics for you
to think through.

## Example

Imagine you've heard on the news that there will be a terrible storm next Friday
around lunchtime with the potential for lightning and power cuts in your area.

Immediately, you're concerned about a few things given your time at Makers and
not wanting to lose valuable learning time! You start writing down some risks:

* Power goes off and my laptop switches to battery power
* Power goes off and WiFi router no longer works
* Lightning strike hits nearby and fries the electrics where I live
* I can't cook my lunch
* The washing that's on the line gets very wet/burnt to a crisp by lightning
  hitting the rotary washing line

While reviewing them, you realise the first one has a related risk you want to
add:

* My laptop's battery isn't charged and so when the power goes off, so does my
  laptop

You think through each of them, for both likelihood and severity, so that you
can come up with some sort of prioritisation.

| Risk | Likelihood | Severity |
|-|-|-|
| Power goes off and my laptop switches to battery power | Medium | Low |
| Power goes off and WiFi router no longer works | Medium | Medium |
| Lightning strike hits nearby and fries the electrics where I live | Low | High |
| I can't cook my lunch | Medium | Low |
| The washing that's on the line gets very wet | High | Medium |
| My laptop's battery isn't charged and so when the power goes off, so does my laptop | Medium | High |

You decide the last two (5 & 6) are the most risky - especially as your battery
is always running low - so they need immediate attention and mitigation. There
are another couple (2 & 3) which might need some attention as well if you can,
plus two others that aren't a big worry for you.

Given that, you decide to:

* Top priorities:
  * Make sure you charge your battery the night before
  * Bring in the washing at 11am, after setting an alarm
* Other steps:
  * Unplug a few vital bits of electronics when the storm starts
  * Tell a coach you might be offline in the afternoon if the power is still
    down

## B&B

Following a similar pattern to the previous example, you will now work through
similar steps with the following solo exercise.

Imagine you run a Bed & Breakfast website for a particular "B&B" of 4 uniquely
decorated rooms. Your website allows people to see the availability of rooms on
dates, to book rooms and pay online.

* Think through possible risks that you, as the administrator (having
  responsibility for designing it, maintaining it, and so on) of the website
  need to take into consideration.
* Once you have a set of risks you're happy with, work through the likelihood
  and severity of each.
* Prioritise the risks using their overall risk level.
* Suggest mitigation strategies for those you consider need attention. This may
  not be all of them - you might decide some are not risky enough to worry doing
  anything about.

  <summary>Can't think of any risks?</summary>

Could there be any related to:

* Technical failures, like bugs
* Human error or malicious users
* Infrastructure failures, like terrible storms

## Securing A Room

Lastly in this phase, it's time for some out-of-the-box thinking around risks
and risk mitigation, with something that sounds like it's an interview question.

How might you make a room secure?

This is a deliberately open-ended question... which itself possibly generates
more questions in your own mind about this room.

Set a timer for 15 minutes and start writing down ideas. It doesn't matter if
those are ways of securing the room, or questions about it that might be useful
to have answers to, or anything else. This is an exercise where you are thinking
about a problem and generating ideas, no matter how good or bad they might
initially appear to be.

There are no right or wrong answers to this, nor a submission to complete,
although you are encouraged to share your ideas with others who have also
completed the exercise to see what they come up with.

<details>
  <summary>If you're a few minutes in to the 15 and are stuck for where to go, expand this section for some ideas.</summary>

* What are we trying to secure/make safe within the room?
* What are we trying to protect that thing or things from i.e. what harm could
  come to it/them?
* Where is the room located and what would it change in our answer?
* What does the room look like inside or already have?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>If you're totally stuck, here's one rather off-the-wall set of thoughts, so you can see the sorts of things you could dream up.</summary>

* The room contains my pet hamster, Hammy, of which I am extremely fond and he
  is surprisingly valuable (he's a pedigree show-winning hamster)
* My rivals in Nibbles (the hamster-equivalent of the dog show, Crufts) are keen
  to steal (or worse!) Hammy
* If the room can be at a secret location, that secret is a way of making Hammy
  safe, so I will need to make sure I'm not followed when I go there to visit
  and feed him
* I'd like the room to be well ventilated, but also secure so that no nasty
  gases can be piped into it either
* Etc.

So some ways of securing a generic room, hamster inhabitant or otherwise, might
be a) secret location and b) clean air. Those might not be appropriate in all
cases though, such as a bank's vault...
