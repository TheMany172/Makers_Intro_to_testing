# Roles, Responsibilities and Quality

For this exercise, you'll work in a group to have a discussion. Your coach(es)
will be putting you into a group for this particular piece of work.

Read through all the instructions in the following section before you all start!

## Exercise - Quality

Allocate roles from the list below to the members of your group - work out
between you who will be in what role (write a random number generator if
needed!). The roles in this organisational team to use are:

* 1* Developer (the person writing the code)
* 1* Product Manager/Owner (the person who knows what the customer wants)
* N* Testers, for however many other people are in your group

We'll be imagining that there's a new program that's to be designed, built and
shipped by your team.

For these two stages in the lifecycle of this program:

* Planning i.e. at the very start
* Late on i.e. after most of the development is done, soon before it will be
  shipped

think about each of the following from the perspective of the role that's been
assigned to you:

* What are your responsibilities?
* What are your main concerns? What matters most to you at this stage?
* What can you do to help improve the quality of the program?
* What other things can you effect - are there processes, tools, lines of
  communication, etc. where the quality of those can be improved? Could those
  improvements indirectly improve the quality of the program?

Discuss these things within your group, setting aside around 20 minutes for each
of the two "stages".

There are no "right" answers here - it's an open question, and is an opportunity
to discuss what "quality" might mean to different people, how they might be able
to affect it, and how those discussions and abilities change with time.

Make notes of any important points that come up, disagreements, difficulties and
questions you have.

Prepare a short presentation (<5 minutes for your group) on your discussion to
present in a session tomorrow morning, where the different groups and coach(es)
will discuss the topics further.
